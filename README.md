# Big Book Versions

This repository is intended to allow anyone to create their own version of the first 164 pages of the book Alcoholics Anonymous.  AAWS no longer owns the copyright on these pages and so copying and modifying this portion of the Big Book should be fair use.  

A Git repository was chosen to house this collection because of the ease of forking different versions of the book and the built in merging and management processes provided by Git.  

The master branch will contain the original version of the first 164 pages.  As of this writing, all of the chapters are in the repository but most still need cleanup as there wwere errors in the copy/paste process.  Feel free to submit a pull request if you want to help in this effort (please make them a manageable size).

Once an clean original version is created, new versions can be branched or forked.
